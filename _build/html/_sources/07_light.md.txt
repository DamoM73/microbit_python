# Micro:bit Light Sensor

A light sensor is an input device that measures light levels. Your BBC micro:bit uses the LEDs to sense the levels of light and lets you program your micro:bit as a light sensor.

```

## Get light level

The micro:bit uses the displayâ€™s LEDs in reverse-bias mode to sense the amount of light falling on the display. 

Returns an integer between `0` and `255` representing the light level, with larger meaning more light.

For example:

```{literalinclude} ./python_files/light/main.py
:linenos:
```

### Light Exercises

1. Create a program that samples light levels using the micro:bit's light sensor every two seconds. It should displays messages based on whether the light level has increased (&uarr;) or decreased (&darr;).
2. Create a program that measures the light level using the micro:bit's light sensor and activates all the LEDs on the micro:bit when the light level falls below a threshold of 100.
