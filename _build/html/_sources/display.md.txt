# Micro:bit Display

We have already used the micro:bit display in our first program. In this section we will learn more of it's features

## Text

### Scroll

Our first program used the `scroll()` function to make a string scroll across the display.

```{literalinclude} ./python_files/first_program/main.py
:linenos:
```

Although our example uses strings, the `scroll()` function can also display **floats**, **integers** and **Boolean** values.

### Show

The other option to display characters is the `show()` function.

Before we can run the code below, we need to:

- stop the micro:bit by clicking on Thonny's **stop** button
- navigate back to the **micro:bit** directory and create a new directory called **display_show**.
- navigate to the **display_show** directory.

Create a new file called **main.py** and add the code below.

```{literalinclude} ./python_files/display_show/main.py
:linenos:
```

**Predict** in detail what you think the program will do. Make sure you are specific in your prediction ("pause for 2 seconds" is better than just "pause"), then **run** the program.
