# Getting Started

## What is MicroPython

MicroPython is a programming language based on Python. It is designed to run on small **microcontrollers**, which are small computer chips that are used in many electronic devices such as robots, sensors, and even some household appliances. Writing programs for microcontrollers is called **embedding programming**.

## What is a Micro:bit

We will be using a educational microcontroller called a Micro:bit. Micro:bits are small, pocket-sized computers that are designed to help people learn about coding and electronics. They have a variety of features, including buttons, a display, and sensors, that can be programmed to perform different tasks.
